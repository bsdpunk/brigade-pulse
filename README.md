# Installation
Make sure you have [bower installed](http://bower.io/#install-bower). To add missing front-end dependencies:

`bower install`

in the project root.  We're still working on a reproducable deploy - for now just run

`python -m SimpleHTTPServer`

in the [public](public) directory and navigate to `http://localhost:8000` to see the site in action.
